          An airport is an aerodrome with extended facilities, mostly for
          commercial air transport.
        </p>
        <p>
          Airports usually consist of a landing area, which comprises an
          aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally
          active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off and to land.

          or a helipad,and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as
          control towers, hangars and terminals, to maintain and monitor
          aircraft.

            Larger airports may have airport aprons, taxiway bridges, air
            traffic control centres, passenger facilities such as restaurants
            and lounges, and emergency services. In some countries, the US in
            particular, airports also typically have one or more fixed-base
            operators, serving general aviation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Operating airports is extremely complicated, with a complex system
            of aircraft support services, passenger services, and aircraft
            control services contained within the operation. Thus airports can
            be major employers, as well as important hubs for tourism and other
            kinds of transit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because they are sites of operation for heavy machinery, a number of
            regulations and safety measures have been implemented in airports,
            in order to reduce hazards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, airports have major local environmental impacts, as
            both large sources of air pollution, noise pollution and other
            environmental impacts, making them sites that acutely experience the
            environmental effects of aviation.
          </p>
          Airports are also vulnerable infrastructure to extreme weather,
          climate change caused sea level rise and other disasters.
